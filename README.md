# Monolithus
There are three main ways to install React in your Rails application.
<ul>
  <li>1)Install React Using Ruby Gems</li>

Build a Monolith with React

Itâ€™s time to build a simple Rails application to manage a list of books we want to read.
Let's start with generating the Rails skeleton.

Generate the skeleton using the rails new command:

```shell
rails new . -d postgresql -j esbuild
```
This command will generate a new Rails project in the current directory.
After running the command, Rails will create the necessary project structure and install dependencies.
